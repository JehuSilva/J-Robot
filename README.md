# J-Robot

This project is an algorithm to solve the obstacle avoidance problem in a mobile robot.

The objective of the robot is to go from point A to point B avoiding the obstacles that are in its path autonomously.

A Wi-Fi camera is used to obtain information on the robot's position, obstacles, the start and end of the trajectory.
